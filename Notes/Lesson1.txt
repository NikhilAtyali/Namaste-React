Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that blocks web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This is done to prevent malicious websites from making requests to our  site on behalf of the user, which could potentially compromise their data or security.
When a web page makes a request to a server, the browser checks the response headers to see if the server has specified that the domain is allowed to make the request. If the domain is not allowed, the browser blocks the request and the server will not receive it.

● What is async and defer?
Async and defer are the attributes which are used in script tags to change the flow of the run of the script tags.
If you have included async in your script tag
<script async src="...></script>
The HTML parsing will continue until the script is fetched.normaly the html parsing stops when a script tag comes in it works in a synchronous manner. but if we use async the browser continues html parsing until script is fetched the html parsing stops and the script parsing will happen.

In case of defer
<script defer src="...></script>
Once the HTML parsing is totally completed the browser will asynchronously fetch the scripts during the html parsing but it waits for the html parsing to be completed and the at last it does the script parsing.
